# RSA-Test

This project is just a very simple way for me to grow my knowlage on RSA encryption and coding in python.
\
WARNING: Due to the venv, this does not have a way to run on a Windows OS


## Setup

In order to setup this project, start by cloning it with:
`git clone https://github.com/glytchninja/rsa-test`
If you dont have git, install it with your package manager (You may need sudo).
For example, on debian, you would run `sudo apt install git`

Once that step is done, make sure you have python3 installed, as this project uses python 3.10 in a venv. This can be done with `sudo apt install python3`, or replace apt with your pakage manager.
\
In order to activate the venv (vertual environment), move into the directory that this is installed on, with `cd rsa-test` or replace rsa-test with whatever directory it is installed onto.
\
Then, activate the venv with `source venv/bin/activate` (`deactivate` to exit and redo the previos step and this step to reactivate)
\
Finnaly, to run the `setup.py` file run the command `python3 setup.py`

### One-liner

Just one thing that you copy and paste to install and setup it all.

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install git && git clone https://github.com/glytchninja/rsa-test && cd rsa-test && source venv/bin/activate && python3 setup.py`

Not recomended


## Running the program

Just a simple `python3 main.py` starts the program.
